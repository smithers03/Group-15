How the game works when you play:

- When the game runs you will see the intro screens, then when prompted you can press
"ENTER" to start

- You can switch between levels by pressing 1 2 and 3 on your keyboard, but you
can only move 1 level at a time. So, in Level 1 you can go to Level 2, and from Level 2
you can go to Level 3, where you can go back to Level 1.

- You can move pacman up, down, left, and right by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

- You have 3 lives, so you can be hit by a ghosts 3 times before the game is over.

- The goal is to get all the pellets in the maze.

- Once you have gotten all the pellets, you will be taken to the next maze automatically.

- Your score is displayed at the bottom if the screen and increases by 10 everytime
Pacman eats a pellet.

- If you lose the game you will be taken to the "Game Over" screen, where you will be
prompted to press "ENTER" to restart the game.
